Please follow the below steps to migrate your Jenkins jobs that were using an application specific Organization (github.com/< mygithuborg >) to HPE Organization (github.com/hpe/< mygithubrepo >).
Fork the hpe4it-jenkins-jobs repo and ensure you are in master branch.
Create a new folder based on your project or application name. For example if your app name is 'myawesomeapp', create a folder named 'myawesomeapp_folder' in the job_dsl folder.
Move inside 'myawesomeapp_folder' folder and create a file named 'myawesomeapp.groovy'
Copy the template available here and update the fields to, point to your app repo and provide your team members the access as needed.
Commit the changes to your fork and raise a Pull request.
Once the pull request is reviewed and merged, the new folder with repos from HPE Organization will be available in Jenkins.
