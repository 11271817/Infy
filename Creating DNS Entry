Follow these steps to raise a request for creating DNS Entry for your application.
Go to Service Now Portal
Login to the portal using HPE Employees SSO
Navigate to Request Something -> Network -> Network Services -> DNS -> New DNS Alias Request
Fill out the form. Provide the Required Information - Requested for, Select the datacenter location and Enter aliases and hostnames
For Example:

Here are all the items you are required to fill while raising a Global and Local DNS entries for an application on Docker-EE CoLo1:



Submit the form by clicking on Submit on the right.
You will now receive an email confirmation from ServiceNow with the Case details.

To create a Local or Global DNS, point your application DNS to the Cname that resolves to the Worker nodes of the Docker-EE UCP and Public nodes of the DC/OS environment.

For a complete list of the CaaS1 & CaaS2 DC/OS and Docker-EE Cluster IPs, Please see here
Requesting a DNS entry for Docker-EE UCP Environment:
Below are the Cname you should be using while requesting a DNS entry for applications on Docker-EE UCP environment.

Docker-EE UCP CoLo1:
* For ITG environment, use --> hrm-itg-docker.dc01.its.hpecorp.net
* For PRO environment, use --> hrm-docker.dc01.its.hpecorp.net

Docker-EE UCP CoLo2:
* For ITG environment, use --> hrm-itg-docker.dc02.its.hpecorp.net
* For PRO environment, use --> hrm-docker.dc02.its.hpecorp.net
Requesting a DNS entry for DC/OS Environment:
Below are the Cname you should be using while requesting a DNS entry for applications on DC/OS environment.

DC/OS CoLo1:
* For ITG environment, use --> mlb-itg-dcos.dc01.its.hpecorp.net
* For PRO environment, use --> mlb-dcos.dc01.its.hpecorp.net

DC/OS CoLo2:
* For ITG environment, use --> mlb-itg-dcos.dc02.its.hpecorp.net
* For PRO environment, use --> mlb-dcos.dc02.its.hpecorp.net
Example Application DNS Naming Standards:
Here are some example naming conventions for a DNS entry on ITG and PRO.

The only difference between a Local and Global DNS is that there will be no Data Center Site number (dc01/dc02) for a Global DNS.
Local DNS example:
* For applications on ITG: app-name-itg.dc01.its.hpecorp.net
* For applications on PRO: app-name.dc01.its.hpecorp.net

Global DNS example:
* For applications on ITG: app-name-itg.its.hpecorp.net
* For applications on PRO: app-name.its.hpecorp.net
Requesting a Local DNS:
Example:

* app-name-itg.dc01.its.hpecorp.net --> hrm-itg-docker.dc01.its.hpecorp.net     #Local DNS for an application on Docker-ITG CoLo1
* app-name-itg.dc02.its.hpecorp.net --> hrm-itg-docker.dc02.its.hpecorp.net     #Local DNS for an application on Docker-ITG CoLo2
* app-name-itg.dc01.its.hpecorp.net --> mlb-itg-dcos.dc01.its.hpecorp.net       #Local DNS for an application on DC/OS-ITG CoLo1
* app-name-itg.dc02.its.hpecorp.net --> mlb-itg-dcos.dc02.its.hpecorp.net       #Local DNS for an application on DC/OS-ITG CoLo2
Requesting a Global DNS:
Example:

* app-name-itg.its.hpecorp.net --> hrm-itg-docker.dc01.its.hpecorp.net       #Global DNS for an application on Docker-ITG CoLo1
* app-name-itg.its.hpecorp.net --> hrm-itg-docker.dc02.its.hpecorp.net       #Global DNS for an application on Docker-ITG CoLo2
* app-name-itg.its.hpecorp.net --> mlb-itg-dcos.dc01.its.hpecorp.net         #Global DNS for an application on DC/OS-ITG CoLo1
* app-name-itg.its.hpecorp.net --> mlb-itg-dcos.dc02.its.hpecorp.net         #Global DNS for an application on DC/OS-ITG CoLo2
