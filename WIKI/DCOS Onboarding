Notes:

As we do not have a seperate dev DC/OS cluster, a dev folder is added in the DC/OS-ITG cluster along with the itg folder. If your application requires custom folders to deploy your applications, please provide your folder names in the yaml file instead of dev and itg.

All the requested groups for DC/OS ITG and PRO will be created on both CoLo1 and CoLo2 DC/OS instances.

Please use a valid HPE email ID in the yaml file to request access for DC/OS.

Emails will be sent with the credentials to the IDs mentioned in the yaml file for both CoLo1 and CoLo2.

If group needs permissions to access other services See here...
NOTE:
          * Make sure in permissions the resourceid(rid) and action is in this format "<resourceid>" : <action>.              
          * Do not add multiple actions to resource in this way
              - "<resourceid>" : create, read, update, delete
          * If you want to add mutiple actions for resources then add resource and action each time. For example
              - "<resourceid>" : create
              - "<resourceid>" : read
              - "<resourceid>" : update
              - "<resourceid>" : delete
          * Permission can only be added to groups but not to users.
